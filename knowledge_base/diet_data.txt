Principle of Healthy Eating:
A healthy diet emphasizes a variety of nutrient-dense foods. This includes lean proteins, whole grains, healthy fats, and a wide array of fruits and vegetables. Portion control is key to managing calorie intake.

Macronutrients Guide:
- Protein: Essential for building and repairing tissues. Good sources are chicken breast, fish (like salmon and tuna), eggs, lentils, chickpeas, and tofu. A general guideline is 0.8g of protein per kg of body weight.
- Carbohydrates: The body's primary energy source. Focus on complex carbs like brown rice, quinoa, oats, and whole-wheat bread. Avoid simple carbs like sugary drinks and white bread.
- Fats: Important for hormone function and vitamin absorption. Healthy sources include avocados, nuts (almonds, walnuts), seeds (chia, flax), and olive oil.

Hydration:
Proper hydration is critical. The standard recommendation is to drink at least 8 glasses (about 2 liters) of water per day. Water helps with digestion, nutrient transport, and temperature regulation.
